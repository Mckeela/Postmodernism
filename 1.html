  <h2>History</h2>
  <p>
    Postmodernism arose after World War II as a reaction to the perceived failings of modernism, whose radical artistic projects had come to be associated with totalitarianism[10] or had been assimilated into mainstream culture. The basic features of what is now called postmodernism can be found as early as the 1940s, most notably in the work of artists such as Jorge Luis Borges.[11] However, most scholars today would agree that postmodernism began to compete with modernism in the late 1950s and gained ascendancy over it in the 1960s.[12]

Salient features of postmodernism are normally thought to include the ironic play with styles, citations and narrative levels,[13] a metaphysical skepticism or nihilism towards a "grand narrative" of Western culture,[14] a preference for the virtual at the expense of the Real (or more accurately, a fundamental questioning of what 'the real' constitutes)[15] and a "waning of affect"[16] on the part of the subject, who is caught up in the free interplay of virtual, endlessly reproducible signs inducing a state of consciousness similar to schizophrenia.[17]

Since the late 1990s there has been a growing feeling both in popular culture and in academia that postmodernism "has gone out of fashion".[18] Arguing from the context of current cultural production, others contend that postmodernism is dead
